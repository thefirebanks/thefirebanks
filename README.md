### Hey there! 👋 

**I'm Daniel, a software engineer @Google! Before that, I was a masters student @USC and worked as a software engineer @IBM for 3 years, in both AI research and product teams.**

🔭 I'm currently working on making generative AI useful for your emails! 🎯

🌱 Also interested in diving deep into the inner workings of LLMs (reliability, controllability, interpretability) and their potential applications outside of tech (science, sustainability, policy, education).
