### Hey there! 👋 

**I'm Daniel, an incoming masters student at USC! I worked as a software engineer @IBM for 3 years, in both AI research and product teams.**

🔭 I'm currently working on a mobile app to incentivize and facilitate spontaneous social hangouts among friends, in Flutter! 🎯

🌱 Also interested in diving deep into the inner workings of LLMs, and the perks and perils of RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback) and RAG (retrieval augmented generation).
